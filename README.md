# Simple_Perceptron_all_logical_gates
In this project we simulate simple perceptron for any given gate by the user except for not.
We get the value of alpha and also ask if the user wants to set the W1 and W2 value themselves or they it to be randomized.
Then calculation begins until 1 round is done with no changes no changes to W1 and W2 and then the program is done.
